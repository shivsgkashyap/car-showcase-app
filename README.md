# Car Rental App | React, Next JS 13, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

_NOTE_ - Initially, I pulled all the car images from an API, including the different angles of the car when a user clicks "view more" (see below). However, as my free trial has expired I can no longer make calls for the car images. Until I find a suitable replacement API for the car images, I have used the stock hero image as a placeholder for the time being.
